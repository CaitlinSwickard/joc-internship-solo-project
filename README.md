# Todo App

This is a simple todo app where users can create new todos, update existing todos, and delete todos. Each todo can be assigned a priority level (high, medium, low), and there is a filter component that allows users to filter todos by priority. The dashboard provides a summary of the number of todos under each priority level and displays a list of the latest todos created. 

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
